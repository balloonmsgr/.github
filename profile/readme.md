# Balloon Messenger
Messaging apps suck. We're making that better.
## Our Goal
As stated above, messaging apps suck. Like, really suck. There's so many different apps, it's difficult to get all of your friends on the same one, some have in app purchases or subscriptions, some have completely arbitrary limitations, some are just plain bad. We're trying to fix this with a free, cross-platform messaging app with everything you'd need.
## How we're going to do this
Building a chat app is hard. That's why like, nobody has done it. Naturally, it's going to take a while to do it. Here's a mock-timeline we made with a rough look into the future and development process (subject to change):
- [ ] [March 2023-April/May 2023] - Get the barebones running. A simple chat app + backend which can do Direct Messages, Group Messages and File Sharing. We expect to get this done by April, with May being used to polish this and make it into something resembling a production-ready app (backend-terms). This will be the core of the app.
- [ ] [June 2023] - Take the groundwork made in March-May, and expand that into a usable, production ready, design complete app.
- [ ] [July 2023] - Take this new app and add remaining features (voice calls, video calls, voice messages, reactions, etc.)
- [ ] [August 2023] - Begin closed beta testing. As of right now, we aren't sure exactly how we're going to select testers right now, though. More info will be available as we get closer to testing.
- [ ] [Rest of 2023] - Likely finished closed beta around October, public beta available from October-November with release in December.
- [ ] [Future] - As time goes on, we plan to introduce feature parity with most other chat apps, as well as our own game-changers. We're super excited with what we're building, and we can't wait for you all to see it. It's going to be great.
### Other Information
Here's something cool: completely native on (most) platforms.
Developing an app (especially a (good) mobile one!) isn't easy. Not at all. So, you have to choose the right framework to at least try to make it a little bit easier on yourself. So, we aren't going to be able to go *completely* native on launch. At launch: Windows, macOS, watchOS, and eventually Linux apps will be completely native. No web technologies **AT ALL**. However, you may notice that we said "(most)" platforms. At launch, we aren't going to be able to make our iOS and Android apps completely native. We currently don't have the resources or expertise to be able to do that, and are going to be confidently sticking with Flutter on the mobile side. We wish we could do full native on mobile, but we just can't. We do have plans to eventually transition to SwiftUI and Jetpack Compose, but during prototyping & betas, it really isn't worth it developing two separate apps. We hope you understand. Also, the web app will be written in SvelteKit due to it's ease of use and low performance overhead. This is about as close to "native" as we'll get on the web, as we aren't especially looking to develop a reactive web app without a JS framework.

Also, this (hopefully) goes without saying, but the all of the apps will be open source. Completely open source (including the backend!). We're waiting until we can get everything to an at least partially usable state to open source it, likely towards the end of April.
