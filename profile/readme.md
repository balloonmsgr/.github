# Balloon Messenger
Messaging apps suck. We're making that better.
## Our Goal
As stated above, messaging apps suck. Like, really suck. There's so many different apps, it's difficult to get all of your friends on the same one, some have in app purchases or subscriptions, some have completely arbitrary limitations, some are just plain bad. We're trying to fix this with a free, cross-platform messaging app with everything you'd need.
## How we're going to do this
Building a chat app is hard. That's why like, nobody has done it. Naturally, it's going to take a while to do it. Here's a mock-timeline we made with a rough look into the future and development process (subject to change):
- [ ] [March 2023-April/May 2023] - Get the barebones running. A simple chat app + backend which can do Direct Messages, Group Messages and File Sharing. We expect to get this done by April, with May being used to polish this and make it into something resembling a production-ready app (backend-terms). This will be the core of the app.
- [ ] [June 2023] - Take the groundwork made in March-May, and expand that into a usable, production ready, design complete app.
- [ ] [July 2023] - Take this new app and add remaining features (voice calls, video calls, voice messages, reactions, etc.)
- [ ] [August 2023] - Begin closed beta testing. As of right now, we aren't sure exactly how we're going to select testers right now, though. More info will be available as we get closer to testing.
- [ ] [Rest of 2023] - Likely finished closed beta around October, public beta available from October-November with release in December.
- [ ] [Future] - As time goes on, we plan to introduce feature parity with most other chat apps, as well as our own game-changers. We're super excited with what we're building, and we can't wait for you all to see it. It's going to be great.
### Other Information
Here's something cool: completely native on (most) platforms.
iOS & Android will be running on React Native. We wish we could do this completely native on mobile, but frankly this is the fastest way to do it. This is what the "(most)" comes from. Even though it's *technically sorta maybe considered* native, it feels like an injustice to call it "completely native." On the other hand: macOS, Windows, watchOS, and Web will be written using **ENTIRELY NATIVE TECHNOLOGIES.** No web technologies **WHATSOEVER** in the desktop/watch apps, and the web app will be written in pure JS (with a framework, likely SvelteKit). A personal pet peeve of ours is apps using technologies like Electron, Flutter (on the web, Flutter mobile is honestly fine), etc. We're not doing that. Completely native. Unfortunately, that does mean that it's going to take a little bit longer to get desktop/watch apps up and running, but it will be worth it. In the meantime, we'll be focusing on making a web app which desktop users can use while we build native apps.

Also, this (hopefully) goes without saying, but the all of the apps will be open source. Completely open source (including the backend!)
